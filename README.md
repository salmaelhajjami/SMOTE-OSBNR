SMOTE-OSBNR is a **hybrid sampling technique** designed to address **class imbalance** in machine learning, combining:
- **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)** for generating synthetic samples of minority classes.
- **OSBNR (One-Side Behavioral Noise Reduction)** for removing noisy or overlapping majority samples.

This method significantly improves classification performance on highly imbalanced datasets, particularly for **credit card fraud detection**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Handles extreme class imbalance effectively.
- Combines oversampling and noise reduction in a two-step process.
- Improves metrics like **G-mean**, **AUC-PR**, **AUC-ROC**, **Recall**, and **F1-score**.
- Validated on multiple datasets and classifiers (GBT, XGB, RF).
